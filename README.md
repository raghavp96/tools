## Tools

Some different projects (v small projects): 

- Idler (Python): simulates mouse movements
- Image outliner (Python): Produces the outline of a given image in the same direcory as the image
- PDF merger (Java): merges two pdfs into one document by appending them together (nothing fancy)
- Bookmark URL Flattener (Kotlin)- takes the Bookmarks JSON from Chrome and flatten out all URLS (for transfer purposes)

### Notes:


The reason all of the commit timestamps are recent is because these projects used to be private repos or stored locally in separate places. In the process of cleaning them up I wanted one consolidated location to look for all of these little projects (and also remove them from local because I was feeling overwhelmed by all the clutter). In the process I lost all commit history from the individual repos :(.
